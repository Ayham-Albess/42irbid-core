# Libft

## Description

Libft is the first major project of the 42 curriculum.  
The goal is to recreate a small C library that includes many of the standard
functions we usually rely on, as well as a set of useful extra tools.  
The project helps build a solid understanding of memory handling, strings,
linked lists, and general C programming practices.  

The library is meant to be reused in many future 42 projects.
